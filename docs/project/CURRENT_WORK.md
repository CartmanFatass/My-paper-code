# HA-CTSE current work — attention pointer

Last updated: 2026-07-27

**This file points attention. It is not a journal and not an archive.** It
answers three questions and nothing else: what is live, what blocks it, and what
standing constraint would make a decision wrong.

Before adding a line, ask where it belongs:

| The thing you want to record | Where it goes |
|---|---|
| A finding, a measurement, a mechanism | an evidence note under `docs/research/cdc/EVIDENCE_NOTES/` |
| A rule for how work is done | `AGENTS.md` if it binds the orchestrator, the subagent's own definition if it binds a worker |
| A ruling and its reconciliation | the round directory under `docs/external-review/rounds/` |
| Which machine runs what | `docs/project/COMPUTE_ROUTING.md` |
| What is live *right now* | here |

It grew to 302 lines of `key=value` and started contradicting itself — naming a
closed round as awaiting answer, pointing at a superseded contract, naming an
older iteration report as the latest. A continuity record nobody can read is not
one. **When a line here stops being about the present, move it or delete it.**

## Live

```text
working_branch=untied-k
execution_mode=authorized
active_assignment_id=D7_S_EVENT_ALIGNED_SOURCE_AUDIT
next_boundary=NEW_STAGE_B_ROUND_THEN_GATED_EXPERIMENT
workflow_position=steps 5-6 of the eight-step loop, re-entered from the Stage B gate
```

**The audit does not launch.** Stage B returned `MISMATCH / NO LAUNCH` on
2026-07-27 with one blocker. That blocker is now closed, so the next step is a
**new Stage B round** covering everything since: the `full_state_fingerprint`
rewrite, the six repaired guards, the dict-ordering fix, and the environment
repair. Steps 2–4 do not repeat — the R3 §E amendment was ruled in the same
round and needs no further freeze.

Nothing is running locally. Cloud run `30270540138` is proving `--workers`
determinism; it is apparatus verification, not evidence.

### Blocked on

- **Formal audit run** — blocked on the new Stage B round, not on cost. Formal
  compute authority is the user's.
- **`--workers` wired into the audit job** — blocked on run `30270540138`
  returning byte-identical.

### Open decisions that are the user's, not mine

- **Ownership of `untied-k`.** Another session committed `d3e0f72` asking that
  ownership be established before either continues. Unresolved.
- **The OS-entropy construction seed.** `scenario_base.py:328` seeds from OS
  entropy and `reset(seed=)` does not re-derive `ground_bs_positions`. Fixing it
  moves the estimand. See the world-replacement evidence note.

## Standing constraints

```text
branch_scope=untied-k only, never touch another branch (user ruling 2026-07-27)
aggressive_branch=another line's, never push
formal_compute=user authority only
review_transport=project_manager_direct
autonomous_research_grant=ACTIVE_TWENTY_ITERATION_OVERNIGHT_GRANT_20260726
iterations_remaining=17
conclusion_bearing_iterations_consumed=20
git_integration_status=project_manager_direct_authorized
intermediate_authorization_prompts=forbidden
experiment_orchestration=hmasd-experiment-operator only, never an ad hoc child
experiment_operator_fallback=forbidden
iteration_report_requirement=required_before_successor
workflow_hash_validation=disabled
uav_user_scope=transient_demand_coverage_plus_charging_roster_change_plus_temporary_detach_failure_robustness
uav_physical_fleet_boundary=fixed_slots_distinct_from_dynamic_service_roster
```

Formal and bounded runs use only the registered nonpersistent
`hmasd-experiment-operator`, fixed to `haiku` with `low` effort. It stays silent
and returns exactly one `COMPLETE` or `ERROR` terminal payload.

No Controller, persistent Monitor, dispatcher, callback route, global write
lease or compatibility line is active.

Iteration reports 1–24 are complete; the next conclusion-bearing report is 25.
`conclusion_bearing_iterations_consumed` counts the **lifetime** total, not
consumption against the current grant — an exhausted-looking pair is not an
exhausted grant.

The workstation is shared with another research line. Check for foreign
processes before any local run and never touch them. Routing rules:
`docs/project/COMPUTE_ROUTING.md`.

## Accepted scientific state

- **D7.S contract frozen at R3** —
  `docs/research/designs/D7_S_EVENT_ALIGNED_SOURCE_AUDIT_R3.md`. Direct live event
  capture, complete-state fingerprint, conditions 1A/1B/1C, cross-limb
  conformance, episode-world provenance.
- **Estimand** — `U*_stable,src / B_H <= -0.10`, `U*_flex,src / B_H >= +0.10`.
  Agent-level; do not reframe to duty level.
- **Scenario-7 is a lossy-exchange source** (part A structural fact); the margin
  quantification awaits the audit.
- **The toy positive control is retired** (swap degeneracy); its retained lemma is
  in `AGENTS.md`.
- **Topology provenance rule** — reused results must prove shared topology or
  scope their claim (`AGENTS.md`, Result interpretation).
- **The ep64 diagnostic is retired as causal evidence.** Its former headline
  numbers must never be quoted; unpaired reanalysis is forbidden, because the
  user-world samples and their provenance do not exist.
- **No D7.S result has ever been published from this instrument**, so nothing is
  retracted by any defect found in it.

## Runtime and protected semantics

```text
python        = C:/Users/fires/.conda/envs/hmasd-amd-cpu/python.exe
torch         = 2.7.0+cpu
torch_threads = 1
backend       = cpu
```

No CUDA fallback, backend mixing, or cross-backend resume. Preserve every closed
source, result and first-match meaning.

```text
concurrency_policy         = file ownership only
same_file_concurrent_writes = forbidden
disjoint_file_parallelism   = allowed
```

## Where things live

|---|---|
| Project Manager instructions — authority, the loop, Stage A/B, acceptance, task sizing, dispatch, review | `AGENTS.md` |
| Standing context every subagent reads | `docs/project/AGENT_CONTEXT.md` |
| Which machine runs what | `docs/project/COMPUTE_ROUTING.md` |
| Scientific method contract | `docs/project/ALGORITHM_PRINCIPLES.md` |
| Cost ceilings and violation semantics | `docs/project/EVIDENCE_COMPLEXITY_POLICY.md` |
| What the paper is about, and the standing check | `docs/project/RESEARCH_GOAL.md` |
| Findings and measurements | `docs/research/cdc/EVIDENCE_NOTES/` |
| Review rounds, questions, rulings, reconciliations | `docs/external-review/rounds/` |
| Closed generations G2–G16 | `docs/research/cdc/CLOSED_GENERATION_BOUNDARY_ARCHIVE_G2_G16.md` |
| Latest Chinese iteration report | `docs/report/ITERATION_24.md` |

Closed generations G17–G20R, UAV G1/G2, the contract-grill mechanism and the D7
part-B margin-instrument era are retired; their evidence notes and round
directories remain under the paths above.
