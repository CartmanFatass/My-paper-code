# Root handoff — Claude hub overnight run (2026-09-15, refreshed 13:40 PDT)

Owner instruction 04:27 PDT: rest until 09:00 PDT; the hub runs the FSD fits overnight and
reports at the 09:00 cron check-in. Two directions driven: FSD and ACVC. Owner 05:45 PDT:
the control-plane edit restriction is lifted (any file, if traceable in Git and documented
under `docs/Claude_docs/changes/`). Nothing here changes lifecycle, priority or slots.

## FSD (flexible_skill_duration) — S allocation complete and intaken

- Twelve of twelve fits complete at `dc4dbdfcd`, collected under
  `docs/research/candidates/flexible_skill_duration/baseline_interruption_b01_20260915/fits/`,
  reduced (`RESULT_SUMMARY.json`) and intaken: SI1280_15 +.00983744 J `small_signed`, df = 3
  interval [−.11564245, +.13531733]; GAP_D_15 −.04526346 J and GAP_I_15 −.03542601 J (untuned
  package gaps, intervals include zero; FLAT not below the package); rollout-5 six-block
  accumulation +.04287702 J [−.02320115, +.10895519]. Both hub modal predictions correct.
  Summed native wall 45,401.07 s. E0, intake, Chinese brief, ledger row (line 27),
  DIRECTION.md, card §9, EXECUTION.md and the direction handoff are committed on `main` and
  mirrored on `codex/fsd`.
- No producer. `em:flexible_skill_duration:convergence` answered the direction question at
  20:27Z with **A, `CLOSE_OBJECT`** (`PRO_FINAL`; packet
  `pro_packets/20260915_post_baseline_interruption_convergence/`, response `0712f85df`):
  stage closed at the bounded claim, no new object, B rejected, C/D not bought; three
  narrowing corrections applied. FSD ACTIVE-idle; reopening facts in the direction handoff.
  Remote worktree and task records reclaimed (`CLEANUP.json`, `task_records/`).
- Direction handoff: `docs/research/candidates/flexible_skill_duration/HANDOFF_2026-09-15_baseline_interruption.md`.

## ACVC — family concluded; M-deployment transfer object selected, Portfolio investment pending

- Block 2 complete and intaken (D2 = F−M −.03919 J, M_ABOVE_MEI; F−C and F−own-dwell UP in
  both blocks; pooled F−M −.0079 J, df = 1 interval [−.406, +.390]). `em:acvc:convergence`
  selected A at 17:08Z (`PRO_FINAL`): the C/M family is concluded at its bounded two-block
  claim; reporting corrections applied; remote worktree and staging reclaimed (CLEANUP.json);
  checkpoints retained locally (PRESERVATION.json). ACTIVE/MEDIUM/recasts2 unchanged.
- Under the owner's 12:57 PDT scope instruction the hub derived the node's unlisted candidate
  into `ACVC_M_DEPLOYMENT_TRANSFER_B01_PROSPECTIVE_CARD_20260915.md`; `em:acvc:convergence`
  selected it with corrections at 20:28Z (**B**, `PRO_FINAL`; packet
  `pro_packets/20260915_m_deployment_transfer_convergence/`, response `71a1ca5b7`). One
  fresh M fit with M / F(M) / own-dwell(M) panels; launch waits for a bounded Portfolio
  investment decision; the L0 proceeds as engineering work with independent review.
- Direction handoff: `docs/research/candidates/acvc/HANDOFF_2026-09-15_post_cm_decision.md`.

## Transport and registry

- Five Pro rounds today (FSD correction, ACVC grant, ACVC post-block-2, FSD post-S
  convergence, ACVC transfer convergence), one accepted submission and one tab each; the two
  afternoon rounds ran concurrently on separate keys/tabs. Registry walks and tab closes for
  the afternoon rounds: see the transport facts under
  `temp/sessions/hmasd-chatgpt-pro-transport/archive/{flexible_skill_duration,acvc}/`.
- Owner 12:57 PDT: deny rules removed, `bind_conversation.py` fix applied (`108f6b277`),
  scope instruction recorded in `CLAUDE.md`.

## Next session

No live handles. FSD: ACTIVE-idle, nothing to do. ACVC: author and send the Portfolio
investment question for the one-fit transfer object; implement the L0 on `codex/acvc` with
independent review; launch only after a conforming Portfolio decision and technical
acceptance. No launch is authorized yet.

## Integration state

`main` carries every accepted `codex/fsd` and `codex/acvc` commit at writing; the two
direction branches carry the direction-owned paths of each main commit. Ledger rows in
`docs/research/portfolio/audit/2026-09-15.md` (lines 14–29).
