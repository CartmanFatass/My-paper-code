# UAV fleet transmission

## 2026-09-30 — B01 prospective complete configuration and frozen-asset study

Direction: `uav_fleet_transmission`; native DM `/root/dm_fleet_transmission`, assigned by
Root on shared main at `/home/fires/hmasd-wsl`. One result-bearing study is active. This
is an exploratory configuration/control-rights/asset-use comparison, with no new learning,
novelty, pure-N, interference-recovery-fraction or skill-causality claim.

### Question, inheritance and selection

Under the original N4/N8 S1 execution-information clock, can ordinary transmitter management
improve complete native service, and does either already-paid final45 H6/SET asset retain
use beyond a competent ordinary physical controller with the same public model and mute rights?
The consequential observation is that old H6 beats contemporaneous SET at N4/c10 and N8/c10,
yet absolute service declines and SINR-ineligible users increase. Capacity still matters:
N4/c10 has roughly 4.14 eligible-unserved users. The new intervention changes interference,
assignment, discovery and subsequent learned histories; it cannot isolate an interference share.

Relevant published background: [RESEARCH topic 3, native S1 capacity/eligibility](https://github.com/CartmanFatass/My-paper-code/blob/cf45e361cba3e8f3230f8d33a8de7175492c4771/docs/research/RESEARCH.md#3-marl-增加的是联合行为和信息结构),
and [complete selection advice](https://github.com/CartmanFatass/My-paper-code/blob/cf45e361cba3e8f3230f8d33a8de7175492c4771/docs/research/RESEARCH.md#portfolio-review-2026-09-30-periodic-efficiency-and-fleet-control).
The capacity identity and conditional one-instance results require separate eligibility and
truncation readings, a strong ordinary controller, and restrained interpretation of N4→N8.
The complete Pro advice was read, including source-access limits. Root adopted its material
dissent against undefined C/E: the concrete one-pass C_N/E below replaces that ambiguity.
Root's independent selection critic supports this revision; reuse covers this actual design,
so no duplicate selection/Pro round is introduced. Independent engineering review and full-result
scientific diagnosis remain distinct. No literature novelty is asserted.

Original evidence/source: `c770220d3abc4e32a9e80347dea87bdea88080e8`, result
`1847293df231c8b567ff9abb73270c81404799ba`,
`runs/load_critical_member_generalization/s1_load_critical_member_b01_20260923/summary.json`.
The N5 radio E positive mean and adverse world29305038 (J −.055369, service −5.710938)
are contrary context (source `4d5ccefe6c90dbc6c132bcc71ffe6dd73535ae47`, result
`46fa68117e523d22f88d617ec35f248cf04ee912`), not an N8 forecast. The N5 LocalController
is 3dB/four-peer/four-step specific and is not the new ordinary comparator.

Constructive prediction: E will remove some unhelpful simultaneous transmission, lower
ineligibility, and improve complete service/J, potentially more at N8. Competing prediction:
lost active capacity, changed discovery, ten-step commitment and frozen actors' unseen silent
feedback will offset immediate gains. All-on belongs to each search set but does not guarantee
nonnegative complete-trajectory effects. C_N/E tests the conditional value of already-paid
assets beyond ordinary use of the added resources; it is finite, discrete, one-step and one-pass,
not an optimum or a test of whether learning is necessary.

### Fixed panel and decision contract

- S1 static50users, N in {4,8}, capacity10 each, H500. Five programs per N:
  H6/all-on, H6/E, SET/all-on, SET/E, C_N/E. Sixteen common new worlds, fixed before outcome
  exposure: IDs `29310000..29310015`; SeedSequence address `[260930,14,world_id,stream]`,
  stream1 users, stream2 eight-UAV positions, stream3 runtime (with N appended). NumPy
  RandomState draws uniform x/y in [0,1000], UAV z in [50,150], member-major order, with
  N4 the first four of eight. No matching seed/identity found in current candidate/config/result
  sources before declaration. World generation does not inspect outcomes.
- Total 160 complete episodes / 80,000 native team steps / 0 new fits / 0 updates. No extra
  C_N/all-on, N6, capacity-matched cells, horizons or training are selected. The 16 worlds
  condition on two old training instances; they are not 16 training replications. N4→N8
  jointly changes vehicles and total capacity40→80.
- Native 0dB threshold, capacity10, original objective
  `J=.7*served/50+.3*mean_connected_quality-.1*(mean_all_UAV_height-50)/100`.
  Silence removes neither vehicles nor their height, movement or N reward scaling.
- H6 coordinator and SET snapshot consume their original global-state fields at t=0,10,...,490;
  local observations and recurrent processing remain every tick. E and C_N use float32
  public coordinates at the same boundaries, retaining quantization error. No fresh global
  simulator fields between boundaries. Added public physics/search/mute rights are common
  resources. Abstract synchronous central compute; no N5 link bitrate/delivery/deadline claim.
- At a boundary the frozen actor steps exactly once under old state/observations/mask,
  progresses its ordinary skill/snapshot/GRU state and outputs the primitive command.
  Original componentwise clip [-1,1] then predicts one next position from the legal snapshot.
  E enumerates all nonempty masks at that position (15/255), ranks native J then served,
  retains the old mask on exact computed-value tie, then lowest bitmask integer. Apply before
  transition t, hold through t+9; do not refresh/reinvoke the actor. Only the mask is held.
  Last search scores position491 while all500 transitions count. Reset mask is all-on.
- C_N each tick starts from previous actually ISSUED discrete joint commands (zero at reset),
  passes members in `((t+j)%N)` order, and tries the lexicographic 27 commands in {-1,0,1}^3.
  Each team prediction starts from the same prestep position; other commands use current pass
  choices. Native per-axis velocity/position clipping, without diagonal normalization.
  Rank larger native J, more served, smaller summed actual Euclidean team displacement,
  entering coordinate command, then fixed lexicographic order. Exact computed ties, no
  adjustable tolerance. Preserve issued commands after boundary clipping. Propagate its
  public position between anchors using those commands. At boundaries finish motion under
  old mask, then E once at chosen position; no joint motion/mask search or second motion pass.

Primary readings are per-world full-service and J increments E−all-on for each asset/N and
paired N8−N4 increment interactions; compare each asset/E to C_N/E. Read all signed worlds,
quality/height/path, eligibility versus capacity, low service tails/zero runs, active masks
and actual cost. Descriptive paired world-bootstrap intervals are conditional on these assets,
not learning confidence or an equivalence/adoption test. Preserve adverse worlds. Positive
mean E with strong C_N retains ordinary management; an asset beyond C_N may retain use; only
instant gains rejects this finite package; unresolved precision does not warrant more worlds.
Any successor, training or richer clock is a separate investment choice returned to Root.

### Cost, resource dependency and assets

Algorithmic requests: 648,000 E mask candidates = 3×16×50×(15+255), plus 2,592,000 C_N motion
candidates = 16×500×(4+8)×27. Separate requests, actual/unique scored candidates, cache reuse,
geometry computations, verification and pure-reader work. Old80k worker354.661wall/1437.160498
CPU-s at4 Torch threads is only an anchor; old N5 reader984.61CPU-s versus worker188.10 warns
against omitting reading cost. New engineering/support/worker/reader timing is not yet known.
Old two final45 training attempts and their selection exposure remain inherited sunk cost.

Root verified required files on wsl_4070 in the old action-law worktree. Preserve it and its
consumers. H6 `s1_action_law_b03_h6_clip_s942201/checkpoint_45.pt`: 23,073,626 bytes,
SHA256 `98d908e4c9d1c33e59707b7da288b0c019f293eced1a99a461f020d1ae069343`;
SET `s1_action_law_b03_set_clip_s943201/checkpoint_45.pt`: 20,968,771 bytes,
SHA256 `03f4f070e30b34fb61cd45820f1579ebde185c9417468689bd0c2e7ef60c0a3b`.
Both under `/home/wu/hmasd-worktrees/agent-count-action-law-20260922-b03/runs/agent_count_generalization/`.
Use original saved configs/final45, normalizers, recurrent/skill reset and clip law. No seed
substitution/retraining if recovery fails. Training commit89486d32e alone lacks posttraining records.

G (`/root/dm_periodic_efficiency`) has first use of wsl_4070 for deadline-sensitive work.
Prepare here; result evaluation or heavy remote work awaits Root's concrete calculation-release
fact, then actual fresh node admission/current active ownership and published source. This is
a CPU/timing dependency, not a science-approval gate. If integration needs a large refactor,
return its cost/scope contradiction instead of extending the finite study.

### L0 — bounded host and ordinary decision layer

Deliver a direction-owned native S1 mask wrapper, new matched worlds, public-state decoding,
one-step native public scoring, E mask enumeration and concrete C_N motion policy. Own
`experiments/candidates/uav_fleet_transmission/{host.py,control.py,__init__.py}` and matching
`tests/experiments/candidates/uav_fleet_transmission/test_control.py`. DM owns runner, reader,
remaining tests and this notebook. No shared core, old evaluator, RESEARCH, index or remote writes
are lent. Native UAVBaseStationEnv has a scenario override incompatible with the generic
mask setter's keyword: adapt locally and reuse the native radio/assignment/observation paths.
All-on must remain equivalent; do not repair inherited observation ordering in this study.
Use exact float64 native scoring arithmetic from quantized public coordinates and original
float32 action arithmetic where applicable, with counters for requests/geometry/reuse.

Checks: all-on native state/action-independent equivalence; muted interference, eligibility,
assignment, user/peer visibility and all-UAV height/N scaling; snapshot timing and no truth
refresh; all nonempty masks and deterministic ties; diagonal/per-axis clipping and retaining
issued commands; one-pass motion under old mask before one E choice; public score against
native0dB physics on synthetic fixtures; RNG invariance. Tests use declared fixtures, not
new study worlds. Preserve 0dB, native constructor/reset and immutable world arrays. Stop at
this behavior and report unsupported semantics/cost; no scientific launch or result exposure.

## 2026-09-30 — implementation, independent engineering acceptance and remaining asset check

The selected concrete contract and independent critic's full response are now published at
`b975b4534d001d470acf2f416785b54e8b5661f5` in the
[retired completed review](../../archive/2026-09-30/RESEARCH-periodic-efficiency-and-fleet-control.md#decision).
The active direction/lead and node canonical policy have been published by Root. The separate
critic specifically retained old-mask motion then one E choice, issued-command persistence,
exact ties and the expanded motion-candidate cost; no unresolved selection dissent remains.

Accepted the bounded Implementer's host/control layer and focused checks. It reuses native
radio/assignment and visibility, overrides Scenario1's mask-call signature locally, and caches
equivalent candidate/row geometry within one decision. The 0dB batch scoring uses at-most-one
eligible transmitter to select each member's top10, with native greedy fallback if numerical
eligibility overlaps; tests compare every15/255 mask and scalar coordinate enumeration exactly.
Only owned paths changed. Original loader, saved-config guard, restore and final45 digest checks
are reused directly; the four named legacy files are identical to the original `c770...e8`.
No broad refactor or alternate training asset was needed.

The complete runner writes per-episode compressed trajectories and decision traces outside
compact JSON. It invokes a pure saved-data reader only after all160 episodes and final frozen
checks. That reader checks every native position/action/assignment/SINR/peer/local-observation,
0dB reward and original N scaling, and reconstructs every C_N pass and E mask set from the legal
public anchors. It never steps an environment or runs an actor. Actor history equivalence is
tested separately. Verification tolerance for adapter scalar×N versus native J is fixed at
1e-14 absolute for averaging roundoff; decision ranks and all other exact checks use no tolerance.
The reader re-materializes each NPZ once per episode. Its candidate/physics CPU is separately
measured; full worker timing also includes recording, loading and final checks. Raw outcome
data remain necessary evidence; runtime log/cache scratch is not a second evidence copy.

Independent `hmasd-reviewer` `/root/dm_fleet_transmission/engineering_review` traced masking,
feedback, reward scaling, once-per-tick actor progression, reset/RNG/config, public precision,
old-mask C/E order/ties, batching/caching, admission and the full reader. It found one real
certification defect: a standalone reader could mark a full panel complete after a failed final
freeze check. Adopted the repair: only an explicit worker-complete marker after checkpoint,
parameter/normalizer/optimizer and full-panel checks permits certification; source/asset/frozen
checks are revalidated. A reader-only technical failure may be repaired over that intact panel,
without changing or rerunning any episode. The regression rejects postcollection worker failure
and parameter, normalizer, optimizer or checkpoint drift. Reviewer reports no material finding
remaining after inspecting repair and tests. It did not independently replay trained actors.

Local correctness verification: 20 initial tests passed; after the repair,6 integration tests
passed (2s class of runtime). Four actual H6/SET×N4/N8 final45 equivalence tests are currently
skipped solely because binaries are not staged locally. These require exact supplied checkpoints,
compare22 sequential decisions across0/10/20 boundaries twice with an intervening recurrent/skill
reset against the original all-on path, and verify no final model/normalizer/optimizer change.
They must pass before result launch. All numerical/control fixtures used old or synthetic
worlds; the declared new panel has not been evaluated.

Root reports G accepted on wsl_4070 at02:47:10UTC, source8ab72e5e2, for its deadline-sensitive
192-episode worker. N therefore continues only local work until G's calculation release. Planned
N tag is `b01_native_s1_a01`; the immutable launcher snapshot will use the published source,
and checkpoint bytes may be read directly from the verified original worktree paths above.
Only the two exact binaries will be copied to owned local temporary input paths for the required
equivalence checks; those redundant check copies will be deleted after use. No old worktree GC.

## 2026-09-30 — final frozen checks and prospective local-node choice

Root established G's calculation release: valid native exit1 at02:52:25UTC, absent worker and
supervisor, matching source/identities. G's scientific result is not completed or adopted by
this fact. Both declared checkpoint binaries were then copied into
`temp/directions/uav_fleet_transmission/final45_checks/<original-tag>/checkpoint_45.pt` and
their exact sizes/SHA256s above matched. All four actual final45 H6/SET×N4/N8 equivalence tests
passed in5.98s (352 native correctness transitions across both paths/resets), including exact
actions, observation/state progression, recurrent/skill runtime and unchanged frozen digests.
Twenty-one other unit/integration tests pass. Existing one-label debug-standard-deviation and
Matplotlib deprecation warnings do not enter actions, native metrics or the frozen digests.

Before any N acceptance, Root supplied the concrete new runtime reliability evidence: G
terminated with CPython `SystemError: unknown opcode` in NumPy `_all_dispatcher`, reached
through `uav_radio.py`'s `np.all(mask)`, after101complete episodes+12steps. Similar peer runtime
failures are recorded, but the root cause is unproven. This is technical missingness, not a
scientific result against G or masking. I choose configured `local_linux` for N's first attempt
because that unresolved repeated failure family makes the remote node unsuitable for this
bounded full-panel collection. No N run has started, moved or been retried. This choice follows
the configured fallback rule and Root's explicit resource release, with no extra outcome pilot.

Actual local runtime: Python3.10.20 (Clang22.1.3), NumPy1.26.3, Torch2.7.0+cpu, x86_64 WSL2.
Keep four Torch threads and one interop thread; all actors remain CPU float32, public coordinates
retain float32 quantization and native physics remain float64. The final45 equivalence checks
ran on this node. This is not a cross-node bitwise replay claim; old remote timing remains only
a historical anchor. An actual-node memory preview at02:54:38UTC found9,276,903,424available
bytes versus4,294,967,296floor; the launch kernel will recheck immediately before release.
G's potential recovery stays outside N's active local calculation window under Root allocation.

The runner/reader now report process-lifetime user/system CPU (native threads included), child
CPU separately, the scoped collection and reader intervals, versions/thread counts, and
process-lifetime RSS explicitly. Collection interval timing excludes module imports/admission;
process totals and the native exit record retain that broader cost. These telemetry additions
change no decision or scientific exposure. Full panel, declared seeds and all160 episodes remain
fixed. The accepted local worker will consume the verified staged checkpoint paths; the source
remote originals remain required, untouched assets. Canonical bulk retention and actual cleanup
follow terminal collection, not an assumption that launch acceptance is a read result.
