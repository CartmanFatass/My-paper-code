## 2026-10-02 UTC / 2026-10-01 PDT — Source, reuse and cost reconstruction before selection

**Assigned question.** Can explicit relational/geometric and permutation structure
help a learned assistant turn available training experience about complete UAV
joint decisions into useful new-world decision quality, compared with the
same-data unstructured numerical learner and competent ordinary rules? The target
is reusable decision generalization. A successful package would not identify
architecture causality or pretrained-language value.

Root subsequently relayed the owner's assignment of detailed proposal construction
to the temporary Astra Max Oracle `/root/successor_allocation_review`. This entry
supplies source/asset/cost facts to that selection; it does not select an architecture,
launch a diagnostic, or make the Oracle a standing approval dependency. Root owns
the initial overlap/investment allocation. The DM retains scientific challenge,
subsequent design refinement, execution and reading. **No new fit, model forward,
native/static query, label or result run is selected or executed here.** Work so far
is primary-source reading, saved-file/schema/hash inspection and notebook publication.
An independent ResearchCritic review must cover the actual consequential selection;
the old B01 disposition does not itself select this successor.

### Inherited explanation and scope

Read the current owner resume and relevant published RESEARCH topics 3, 4 and 8 at
`35332c2ce`: shared reward does not create decentralized information; trainability,
new-world decision quality and complete-package usefulness are different; symmetry
must match actual information/action/transition semantics. These alter the proposed
interpretation: this host is one centralized initial complete-layout selection with
a frozen executor, not a test of changing teammates, decentralized credit or an
autoregressive learned executor. Preserve native service/reward consequences, not
just loss, accuracy or coordinate proxies.
Before publication, refreshed `origin/main` and read Root's current three-DM
allocation/owned exploring entry at `9e2d12418`; the substantive background above
is unchanged, and the new allocation records the same source-only preparation.

The original B01 [complete reading](../typed_joint_skill_decision/NOTES.md#b01-complete-reading),
[full independent diagnosis](../typed_joint_skill_decision/NOTES.md#b01-independent-result-review)
and [disposition](../typed_joint_skill_decision/NOTES.md#b01-independent-disposition)
were read in full. Published result `7a488add8`, retirement `09a69ed0e`; exact
recipe source/tests are recoverable at
[`61a2dfa9cde0178d482d0a079c5629c3bcb7789e`](https://github.com/CartmanFatass/My-paper-code/tree/61a2dfa9cde0178d482d0a079c5629c3bcb7789e/experiments/candidates/typed_joint_skill_decision).
The source is retired from current main, not missing empirical evidence.

| B01 quantity, block 1 / 2 / 3 | Values |
|---|---|
| N final training menu regret | .000608594 / .000804063 / .000519219 |
| N final exposed-test menu regret | .098826250 / .101463125 / .101863438 |
| L-F final training regret | .100506875 / .096801875 / .103364375 |
| L-F final exposed-test regret | .123149063 / .083615625 / .106664375 |
| Native menu best minus training-selected fixed | .085838125 / .075858125 / .080320625 |
| Static rule regret | .000596563 / .001286563 / .001146250 |
| N final minus fixed, complete C_bh | -.012988125 / -.025605000 / -.021542813 |

N's real updates and near-perfect training choice weaken an absent-learning or
unable-to-fit account. They do not identify the missing representation, amount of
data, objective or optimizer. L-F's weaker training fit is a different finding.
The complete menu has genuine conditional opportunity, while static ranking wins
341/384 test worlds and both learned packages fall below fixed in every block.
Retain the active severe losses and local gains; no common failure diagnosis, no
general impossibility conclusion, and no claim that flat N tested geometry-aware
learning. A useful gain over fixed/unstructured policies need not beat static to
establish a narrower capability, but static's strong performance remains material
to deployment and further investment.

### Exact decision object and fitted exposure

Source locations below refer to `61a2dfa9c`, paths under the historical direction.
A bounded registered Scout reconstructed these paths read-only; the DM additionally
read the load-bearing representation, preparation, label, optimizer and selection
source and the original complete result review.

- `contract.py:150–214`, `models.py:24–44`: legal learner information is initial UAV
  XYZ `[6,3]`, user XY `[50,2]`, BS XYZ `[3]`, and up to eight complete plans with
  assigned target XYZ `[6,3]`, `kind`, `k`, construction slot, legal mask and display
  order. World/seed IDs, native scores, outcomes and generation provenance are
  excluded. N repeats 121 shared geometry scalars plus 18 assigned-target scalars
  per candidate, divides every coordinate by 5000, and appends kind3+k3+slot8 one-hots:
  **153 inputs**. No learned or training-set normalizer is used.
- `run_b01_native.py:152–187`, `contract.py:91–147`: the menu is built from the full
  reset with a private `PCG64(0)` on a deep-copied environment before outcomes.
  The raw constructor uses geometry, not outcome-ranked full-planner outputs.
  Preferred construction slots are three plain k4/5/6, three relay k4/5/6,
  another distinct relay and one flat. Canonical exact sorted-row XYZ de-duplication
  and relay/flat/plain filling preserve at most eight distinct layouts. Ranking
  within those construction classes uses served-subset size, layout hash, then
  source index; this is construction metadata, not measured Q.
- Target matching minimizes maximum travel distance, then total travel distance
  across the 6! permutations. Exact ties retain the first permutation. B01 passes
  canonical row-sorted layouts into matching and stores targets in UAV identity
  order. `run_b01_native.py:189–205` executes that fixed assignment by the frozen
  closed-loop straight-line move/hold executor over all H500 native steps. No
  averaging of alternative target coordinates occurs.
- `run_b01_native.py:284–298`: label `Q` is complete episode mean
  `coverage_backhauled`, the fraction of 50 users attached to routed UAVs, not the
  contract reward, terminal coverage or a static score. Each world has all eight
  complete outcomes, and soft labels are `softmax(Q/.02)` over legal candidates.
  Feature hashes, slot order and target identities bind labels to prepared inputs.
- `models.py:214–220`, `run_b01_learning.py:183–230`: N is shared-candidate
  153→256→256→1 GELU, 105,473 parameters. Each block has independent 256-train and
  128-test worlds. Base seeds are 106100000/106200000/106300000; N initialization
  uses base+20001 and shuffling base+20002. N fits 64 epochs, batch32, AdamW
  lr .001/weight decay .0001: **512 updates and 16,384 world exposures per fit**.
  Float32 CUDA, TF32 disabled; masks/soft-CE/argmax are fixed. L-F uses the same
  labels and exposure with its frozen 1024-dimensional features and separately
  adapted scorer (1,052,673 parameters, lr .0001). Different capacity/optimization
  is part of that package contrast.

### What structure can and cannot mean here

N already uses one scorer shared across candidate rows. Reversing only candidate
display order changed N's chosen slot in **0/384** old test worlds, versus
**239/384** for L-F. Thus candidate-display dependence is not an established N
bottleneck. The common exact-logit tie rule chooses the first displayed option;
zero observed reversals is not a universal floating-point/tie invariance proof.

User rows are flattened by N without a shared user encoder. The actual
`envs/pettingzoo/uav_env.py:523–556` generator puts five clusters in consecutive
ten-user blocks; within each block is Gaussian draw order, with clipping. Thus
the old flat vector retains a cluster-block ordering cue, even though explicit
cluster labels/centers are excluded and users have equal weight with no separately
sampled demand/type. Removing this ordering is a representation restriction; do
not silently assume the old input was an arbitrarily shuffled set. UAV initial rows and
assigned-target rows are flattened in paired UAV identity order. A representation
may compute coordinate relations/distances from these already supplied values
without collecting another outcome or environment observation. A joint permutation
must preserve each UAV's initial/target pairing. Permuting targets alone changes
the executed assignment; regenerating menus after changing row order is not the
same intervention as changing the scorer's presentation of an already fixed plan.
The constructor, canonical coordinate/hash ordering, assignment ties, native radio
ties and numerical reductions must not be silently equated with arbitrary exact
symmetries of the full data-generation pipeline.

The exact B01 host uses deterministic free-space path loss and no shadowing;
the source's separate 3gpp elevation/LOS branch is not this experiment. The task
fixes a ground plane, altitude limits, box and BS; arbitrary 3-D rotation,
translation or reflection is not justified by the word geometry. The old S7 fixed
NE normalization result in RESEARCH topic8 is specifically adverse and does not
test this host or prove that its generator is invariant. A structured package is
a conjecture about finite learning on this legal object, not an identified cause
of the previous loss.

`run_b01_native.py:251–263` gives the static comparator the legal instantaneous
native radio evaluator on the initial positions and each proposed complete target
layout. `contract.py:217–227` ranks static coverage, with max/total travel/slot
tie breaks; its travel variant uses an arrival-time surrogate. These rules have
known task computation, no future H500 truth and no fit. Full planning is a separate
test-only scale reference, performing flat then relay search with two 3000-query
ceilings. A future learner supplied static coverage, route membership or another
computed physical summary receives additional task computation/knowledge even
though it is derived from the same exogenous geometry; give an ordinary comparator
the same addition and count it. A raw-coordinate representation contrast and that
knowledge-enriched package contrast have different interpretations.

### Existing data can be reused without regenerating B01

At 2026-10-02 00:19 UTC, read-only SSH confirmed all three original roots on
`hmasd-wsl-node`, under `/home/wu/projects/HMASD/runs/typed_joint_skill_decision/`.
The complete manifests and summaries were hashed again and matched published
locators; this check did **not** repeat every per-file hash audit or replay a model.

| Phase | Summary SHA256 | Manifest SHA256 |
|---|---|---|
| `b01_native_a01` | `a483734dbb8aa24c440f83378694945ff99fb038b194b53b5d32ce9ea30eda5a` | `f38fa0f8159ccd45874771886b0977eab15ea2e1978cb94fa41630874b8aca0d` |
| `b01_learning_a01` | `5052c2c2560e707b7ad6ddaddef25fd74bc92444a328889776600d5cc4473b93` | `16aca6b9ec339a7f7fa94b7d4a86eed34d917cbee956a9db2f810f132d32bd85` |
| `b01_read_a01` | `213be039392a3d69b8d66935ae884316875b8e9e371a86d4b5f580fbc1191271` | `d211d941250d3daea7ed14fde17395e6fc8720e831de05d13bbaa192471b94e3` |

Verified the stored schemas and paths (representative record inspected, all six
initial/final checkpoint paths enumerated):

- Native `prepared/b{1,2,3}/{train,test}/{world}/features.json`, `provenance.json`
  and `codec.json`; labels live separately at
  `worlds/b*/{train,test}/{world}/labels.json`, alongside `slot0.json`…`slot7.json`.
  Labels contain `address`, `feature_sha256`, `slot_order`, `Q`, `soft_targets`,
  `ordinary`, all `candidate_results` and raw-trace locators. Existing geometry,
  labels and ordinary scores are therefore sufficient for declared development
  without another reset, candidate construction or native trajectory.
- Learning `fits/b*/{N,L}/initial.pt`, `final.pt`, `optimizer.pt`, config,
  `updates.jsonl`, summary and initial/final/reversed test JSON files are present.
  CPU-cloned N state dictionaries are self-contained once the exact numerical
  architecture is reconstructed. L-F's scorer alone is not the full deployment
  package; it also needs the one retained frozen source/tokenizer and vendor binding.
  The old dedicated environment was retired. This numerical question need not
  restore the entire language runtime or duplicate that weight object.
- Reader `blocks/b1.json`, `b2.json`, `b3.json` retain the original full readings.
  Local compact [summary](../../../../runs/typed_joint_skill_decision/b01_read_a01/summary.json),
  [384-world table](../../../../runs/typed_joint_skill_decision/b01_read_a01/per-world.csv)
  and [cost reading](../../../../runs/typed_joint_skill_decision/b01_read_a01/cost-summary.json)
  already support paired fixed/static/N/L comparisons and old-world regret by
  arithmetic, without model or native calls. All-eight-option Q lives in the
  canonical labels, not the compact CSV.

All B01 test outcomes have been exposed to the research team and this selection.
They can be named development evidence, never a genuinely fresh successor
endpoint. Reusing the old three N final checkpoints would cost zero new N fits,
with inference still billed and the comparison conditional on those training
instances. A new fitted arm, re-fit control, tuning choice, augmentation or label
reweighting must have its own prospective exposure; it is not free because the
data were already paid. Any fresh-world endpoint and all stopping/selection rules
remain to be fixed in the actual selected study.

### Primary-source and historical boundaries supplied to selection

All three local stores were searched; the load-bearing passages below were read
directly. They are antecedents and constraints, not a novelty verdict or proof of
UAV generalization.

- Repository foundation **B01**, Albrecht/Christianos/Schäfer,
  `docs/new-libs/papers/B01_Albrecht_MARL_Foundations_2024.pdf`, PDF pp.304–307
  (printed pp.275–278), §9.7: distinguish weak agent interchangeability from
  identical-policy optimality; pooled shared parameters can aid learning but can
  impose an inappropriate policy restriction. Mapping here: a shared entity
  encoder must still retain initial/target/role distinctions. The source's
  parameter-sharing example does not establish variable-N or this scorer's gain.
- Inst-sci **MARL-0571**, McClellan et al., JSON
  `/home/fires/projects/Inst-sci/papers/MyLib/json/MARL-0571.json`, corresponding
  `pdf/MARL-0571.pdf`, pp.3–5: geometry-equivariant messages use relative squared
  distances, with task symmetry assumptions; their vanilla EGNN action output also
  has an exploration bias. This paper's RL action-exploration repair does not
  transfer directly to our offline scalar ranker over a fixed complete menu.
  [Official primary record](https://papers.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/hash/4830a9b95a2f63fc4b3fe09abc18f045-Abstract-Conference.html).
- Inst-sci **MARL-0078**, Utke/Houssineau/Montana, JSON
  `/home/fires/projects/Inst-sci/papers/MyLib/json/MARL-0078.json`, corresponding
  `pdf/MARL-0078.pdf`, pp.3–4: MARC's relational abstraction explicitly drops
  absolute position **and distance**, assumes relative predicates suffice, and
  warns that continuous-state abstraction may lose consequential information.
  For this radio task, near/far distances and altitude can matter. The analogy
  motivates representing relationships, not blindly copying its distance-free
  predicates or inheriting its claimed task results.
- My-lib **icml-2023-pmlr-v202-chen23i**, Chen et al., arXiv 2305.18951,
  `/mnt/c/Projects/My-lib/.local-formal-capture/corpus/papers/icml-2023/pmlr-v202-chen23i/arxiv-2305.18951.pdf`,
  pp.3–4: the model preserves the subgroup fixing gravity rather than imposing
  full O(3), because external forces distinguish directions. Mapping: altitude,
  ground, BS and bounds constrain a UAV symmetry claim. Morphology-agnostic
  locomotion results are not evidence that our scalar selector will generalize.
  [Official primary record](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/chen23i.html).

July evidence is also not a blank slate. The
[G11 original result](../../cdc/EVIDENCE_NOTES/20260723_SLOT_LAYOUT_INVARIANCE_G11_FORMAL_RESULT.md)
reports invariant outcomes under four controlled slot maps for three imported
checkpoints, zero new optimization; its
[prelaunch source correction](../../cdc/EVIDENCE_NOTES/20260723_SLOT_LAYOUT_INVARIANCE_G11_PRELAUNCH.md)
kept autoregressive position draws, rather than incorrectly remapping them by
lifecycle key. This demonstrates a specific distinction between semantic
relabeling and changing the random decision program; it is not new-world UAV
learning. The [R30 design](../../designs/R30_FIXED_CLOCK_AR_EDIT_DESIGN_20260714.md)
already contains complete autoregressive joint editing. The original
[R54 external review](../../../external-review/gpt5_6_pro/20260717_r54_hfsr_result/GPT5_6_PRO_RESPONSE_RAW.md)
accepts implementation validity but reports failed full-set supervised access and
does not identify a unique representation/optimization root cause. It even proposes
direct member–candidate relations as a subsequent conjecture. Therefore neither
complete joint decisions, full inputs, supervision nor relational terminology is
new in itself; these historical contracts are not revived or made admission gates.

### Feasibility and complete price facts, before a design is selected

The numerical representation seam is `numeric_rows`/the scorer, after the frozen
feature object is constructed and before `masked soft-CE → argmax slot`.
Reading preserved data, computing deterministic geometry transforms and training
with it can be isolated in this direction's own small implementation/tests. A fresh
endpoint would additionally use the original read-only native constructor and
executor at their bound hashes. Do not restore the whole retired language recipe,
modify Claude's host, or silently change its assignment/menu semantics. Concrete
implementation L0, high-risk engineering review and launch inputs follow selection.

Already-paid B01 price is **6 fits, 3,072 updates, 4,808,000 native steps,
783,749 static queries, 1,552 full frozen source forwards** and the complete
5,376-scorer-context/9,600-episode reader. Admitted-process CPU was 7,261.651462s;
GPU reserved window 547.037157s. This is cumulative exposure inherited by a
successor, not its new bill. Support was incompletely metered.

The three N fit summaries give active training wall **3.376905 / 3.842079 /
4.060591s**, each for 512 updates. These omit input preparation, process/GPU
reservation, checkpointing and independent reading; they cannot price a new graph
architecture. Old per-world menu construction/matching average about .011/.017s;
static scoring adds about .0043s. N's assembled old test selection is .0291s versus
static .0328s, expressly not a measured complete online benchmark. Native step
timer totals 4642.777401s over 4.808M steps; nested timers overlap and must not be
added as independent CPU.

Exact scalable counts can be declared without a pilot: each new arm retaining
64×256 training exposure costs 512 updates and 16,384 world contexts per block;
three blocks cost 3 fits/1,536 updates/49,152 contexts for that arm. A fresh endpoint
of m worlds with all-eight-option native regret costs **8m H500 episodes = 4000m
native steps**, plus construction/matching/static queries, endpoint inference and
reading. Executing only selected distinct slots can cost less but no longer gives
exact full-menu regret. Reusing old training labels costs zero new label episodes;
choosing fresh training data does not. Full-planner search is optional for a future
scientific question, not automatically copied from B01; if bought, count its
actual search calls and complete episodes. A new model's runtime/RSS/engineering
cost remains unmeasured, not zero or the old MLP's cost.

**Current disposition:** source/asset reconstruction supports a feasible new-world
learning comparison and identifies design hazards, not an empirical geometry
benefit. No architecture, new batch or hypothesis-repair chain is selected here.
Root's concrete initial allocation/design integration is the pending dependency;
this does not stop independent source work or create a per-fit permission loop.
No producer/observer was created, no bulk was copied, and no deletion was performed
in this preparation (0 bytes reclaimed). Original adverse evidence stays canonical.
